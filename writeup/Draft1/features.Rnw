\section{Introduction and background}
Intro to lineups \citep{Buja:2009hp, mahbub:2013, wickham:2010, Hofmann:2012ts}

The change to lineups we make is to introduce a second target to each lineup. We then keep track of how many observers choose any one of the two targets (to assess the difficulty of a lineup), and additionally we  record how often observers choose one target over the other one. This is information that we can use to evaluate how strong the signal of one target is compared to the other one. 

A further extension of this testing framework are the use of color (in a qualitative color scheme), the use of shapes, and additional density lines - we anticipate that all of these features are going to emphasize the clustering component. 
On the other hand, regression lines should emphasize any linear trends in the data.
