This repository contains the data and code necessary to reproduce the images in the study, as well as the paper describing the study and results. 

## Quick Links

* The [Code](Code) folder contains the R code necessary to generate pictures, format the data, and reproduce some of the initial analysis of the data. Some additional analysis code is embedded in the [Rnw file used to generate the paper](FullPaper/Revision/features-jcgs.Rnw).

* The [Data](Data) folder contains the data necessary to generate the images, as well as anonymized user data and simulation study results. See the [Rnw file used to generate the paper](FullPaper/Revision/features-jcgs.Rnw) to understand how these files fit into the analysis in context.

* The [Images](Images) folder contains the data sets and statistics about the data sets used to generate the lineups in this study. The images must be generated using R, and are not provided in this repository in rendered form.
